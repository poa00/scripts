My collection of bash/perl/expect scripts. Mostly tested on Solaris/Linux/Mac.
All downloaded, third-party softwares are organized into a separate directory.
Mostly useful for cron automation, ease of handling, & development assistance.
Gathered from various internet sources. I've forgotten sources to attribute to.

Any doubts, please feel free to drop me a mail @ ravikirandotks-at-gmail-dot-com
